Contributor : Hyung-Seok Shim and Seung-Nam Park (They are with Korean Research Institute for Standards and Science)  

This repository includes jypyter notebook file which contains codes to perform numerical analysis for calibration interval with NCSLI S3 method and Markov Chain Monte Carlo(MCMC) method. The results shown in this notebook are being prepared in a paper titled **"Numerical experiments for application of Markov Chain Monte Carlo to establishment of calibration intervals"**.

Readers can freely implement methods to establish calibration intervals using this notebook. Any comments related to this notebook are welcome.
